# Easy graph algorithms

change_graph_representation.cpp - Program for representing directed graph as Adjacency Matrix, Incidence Matrix and Incidence List.

algorithms.cpp - Algorithms for:
- finding isolated nodes in graph;
- checking if the graph is regular;
- for a graph represented with an Adjacency Matrix:
	- determines Distance Matrix;
	- checks if the graph is Conex

graf.txt:
The first line contains two numbers, separated by a space M, N, the number of nodes and the number of vertexes for the graph.
The following M lines describe the vertexes with pairs of nodes x, y, separated by a space.
The nodes are indexed from 0.
